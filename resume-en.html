    <p><strong>Working Experiences</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2018.04 - Current Lily Software Inc, Manager/Engineer, R&amp;D</strong></p>
    <p>Coordinate, and direct multiple business divisions on joint efforts product research, and development; Responsible for delivering research projects including Natural Language Understanding in Movie and Television domain, Intelligence Customer Service. Projects worked on cluding:
    <ol>
        <li>
            The Intelligence Customer Service System has been deployed to the client's internal EIP system. The system consists of three modules: intention recognition, standard problem matching, and similar problem matching. Find accurate answers through question matching.
        </li>
        <li>
            Construction of a Knowledge Map based on the Film and Television Domain, collect data from different data sources into a central database through crawlers, followed by data cleansing, merging, establishing relationships, and feeding them into a graph database. Make Q &amp; A based queries on the knowledge map.
        </li>
        <li>
            Configurable Natural Language Training and Inference System, establish a natural language training and reasoning system. The system includes a model training network based on the configurable system. The system can be extended to provide system support on rapid modeling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Speech Emotion Classification， classify six different emotions using non-verbal vocal expressions, and designed a two backbone model. The first is a dual-channel neural network model using CRNN and DNN. The second is xgboost. The combination of those two models processes the non-verbal vocal expression to get the classification results.
        </li>
        <li>
            Voice Wake-up and VoicePrint Recognition, a combination of voice wake-up and voice print. The system enables personalized voice wake-up. Followed by noise reduction and ASR. It is a web-based system.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>2008.03 - 2018.03 &nbsp;IBM Research/Development Manager, Architect, Sr. Engineer</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Building a big data platform and upgrading the existing legacy ERP system for John Deere. Designed and developed a data warehouse, data cubes, and data visualization portal and upgraded its ERP system to a .NET-based platform.
        </li>
        <li>
        Develop an IBM Intelligent Customer Service System, which divides knowledge into four predefined aspects: hardware, software, servers, and services. Every human-machine communication makes the machine closer to finding the targeted knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
        Developed Pfizer's multilingual product marketing system. The team is distributed in four regions: India, Europe, China, and United States, and builds a content-based management system using ElasticSearch, Machine Learning， etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed an iPhone-based wealth management platform for Citibank. The project consisted of UI, SOA, and IoS teams. The system provides privileged Citibank customers the services such as stock and options trading and purchasing bank wealth management products.
