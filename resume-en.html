    <ol>
        <li>
            The Intelligence Customer Service System has been deployed to the client's internal EIP system. The system consists of three modules: intention recognition, standard problem matching, and similar problem matching. Find accurate answers through question matching.
        </li>
        <li>
            Construction of a Knowledge Map based on the Film and Television Domain, collect data from different data sources into a central database through crawlers, followed by data cleansing, merging, establishing relationships, and feeding them into a graph database. Make Q &amp; A based queries on the knowledge map.
        </li>
        <li>
            Configurable Natural Language Training and Inference System, establish a natural language training and reasoning system. The system includes a model training network based on the configurable system. The system can be extended to provide system support on rapid modeling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Speech Emotion Classification， classify six different emotions using non-verbal vocal expressions, and designed a two backbone model. The first is a dual-channel neural network model using CRNN and DNN. The second is xgboost. The combination of those two models processes the non-verbal vocal expression to get the classification results.
        </li>
        <li>
            Voice Wake-up and VoicePrint Recognition, a combination of voice wake-up and voice print. The system enables personalized voice wake-up. Followed by noise reduction and ASR. It is a web-based system.
        </li>
        <li>Development of a personalized voice trigger based on Convmixer and ECAPA-TDNN. Developed real-time, lightweight <a href="https://xingweiliang.github.io/Lite -RTSE.html">Speech Enhancement</a> models. </li>
