    <strong>Brief Summary</strong><BR>
        I am the AIoT Technical Director of Konka Corporation. Previously worked as a Delivery Supervisor, Manager, Solution Architect, and Senior Software engineer at IBM (Los Angeles), led multiple R&D teams to participate in technical projects such as complex system integration, human-computer interaction, Internet of Things and data mining, and has been successfully deployed in John Deere, Pfizer, Citibank, and IBM's internal production systems. <br><br>
        In 2004, I received a Master's Degree in Computer Science from Utah State University. In 2011, I entered the University of California, Riverside, for part-time post-graduate studies for two years. In 2018, I came to Shenzhen to join Huawei's R&D team and worked with other experts to explore Huawei's expansion in overseas markets in Artificial Intelligence and Digital Transformation. <br><br>
        I am working on Artificial Intelligence technologies at Konka Corporation, focusing on speech and natural language processing. Regarding speech processing, research works in keyword wake-up, voiceprint recognition, and noise reduction; in natural language processing, developing technologies related to human-computer dialogue. <br><br>
