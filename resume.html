<p><strong>Brief Summary</strong></p>
<p>Currently working for Lily Software as Principle&nbsp;Consultant. Mainly on clients&rsquo; AI projects, I worked with co-workers on delivery projects for companies like South America Telecom, Indonesia Telecom, and Konka Corporation. Projects delivered include Speech Enhancement, Speaker Recognition, Speech Emotion Recognition, Natural Language Understanding, and Knowledge Graph.</p>
<p>I worked for IBM for 10 years before&nbsp;Lily Software as Solution Architect and Senior Software Engineer, I have worked&nbsp;on multiple projects, including System Integration, Human Machine Interaction, the Internet of Things, and Data Mining. Many of those projects have been deployed into production systems in John Deere, Pfizer, CitiBank, and IBM internally.</p>

<p><strong>Working Experiences</strong></p>
<p><strong>2018.04 - Current Lily Software Inc, Manager/Engineer, R&amp;D</strong></p>
<p>Projects and Responsibilities:</p>
<p>Coordinate, and direct multiple business divisions on joint efforts product research, and development; Responsible for delivering research projects including Natural Language Understanding in Movie and Television domain, Intelligence Customer Service.</p>
<ol>
<li><em><u>Project: Intelligent Customer Service System</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>The customer service system has been applied to the client&rsquo;s internal EIP system. The system is mainly divided into three modules: intention recognition, standard problem matching, and similar problem matching. Find accurate answers through question matching.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em><u>Project: Construction of a Knowledge Map based on the Film and Television Domain</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>Collect data from different data sources into a central database through crawlers, followed by data cleansing, merging, establishing relationships, and feeding them into a graph database. Make Q &amp; A based queries on the knowledge map.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em><u>Project: Configurable Natural Language Training and Inference System</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>Establish a natural language training and reasoning system. The system includes a model training network based on the configurable system. The system can be extended to provide system support on rapid modeling.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em><u>Project: Speech Emotion Classification</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>Classify six different emotions using non-verbal vocal expressions, and designed a two backbone model. The first is a dual-channel neural network model using CRNN and DNN. The second is xgboost. The combination of those two models processes the non-verbal vocal expression to get the classification results.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><em><u>Project: Voice Wake-up and VoicePrint Recognition</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>A combination of voice wake-up and voice print. The system enables personalized voice wake-up. Followed by noise reduction and ASR. It is a web-based system.</p>

<p><strong>2008.03 - 2018.03 &nbsp;IBM Research/Development Manager, Architect, Sr. Engineer</strong></p>
<p>Projects and Responsibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><u>Project: Jonh Deere, Big Data, ERP System, 2010.07 - 2012.09</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>The project has two parts: building a big data platform and upgrading the existing legacy ERP system. As project Architect, I have worked with the team to design and develop the data warehouse, data cubes, and data visualization portal. Project phase two is to upgrade the Power Builder-based ERP system to a .NET-based platform. The architecture is API based solution with Security, Auditing, and Fault-tolerance in focus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em><u>Project: IBM Intelligent Customer Service System, 2012.09 - 2014.03</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>The project was a joint effort of two teams based in the USA and Canada. As the project architect and engineer for this project, I worked with the team to design and implemented the human-to-machine conversational system. The system divides knowledge into four different pillars: hardware, software, servers, and services. Each pillar is pre-defined domain content. With each conversation with the human, the machine will get closer to the targeted knowledge. The system is implemented on RSA, Java, based on Ontology, and MongoDB. It has been deployed on IBM's internal product line.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em><u>Project: Pfizer, Big Data and System Integration, 2014.04 - 2016.04</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>Worked on products marketing system for Pfizer as Solution Architect. The team is globally distributed in India, Europe, and China. While working with Pfizer executives in New York City, we built a content management system including SOLR, and Lucene, with added Machine Learning Algorithms on targeted customers. The system back end connects to Pfizer&rsquo;s backbone SAP system. &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em><u>Project: CitiBank, Wealth Management Platform, 2016.04 - 2018.03</u></em></li>
</ol>
<p>The project has 4 teams developing a Wealth Management Platform for Citibank in New York. I coordinated with the business team and data provider to accomplish the required tasks. The development team consisted of a UI design team, a back-end SOA team, and two front-end IoS Teams. Each team has 10 engineers. I guided the back-end SOA team in API design and development. Established Agile management for all teams. As the development team leads for this project, I have also focused on security in design from start. The system went live successfully. It provides Citibank customers to do stock, options trade, bank wealth product purchases, and other bank-defined wealth products. &nbsp;</p>
