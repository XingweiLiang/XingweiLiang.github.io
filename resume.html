<p>Brief Summary</p>

<p>Currently working for Lily Software as Principle Consultant. Mainly on clients' AI projects, I worked with co-workers on delivery projects for companies like: South America Telecom, Indonesia Telecom, Konka Corporation. Projects delivered include: Speech Enhancement, Speaker Recognition, Speech Emotion Recognition, Natural Language Understanding, and Knowledge Graph. </p>

<p>I worked for IBM for 10 years before Lily Software as Solution Architect, Senior Software Engineer, I have worked on multiple projects, including: System Integration, Human machine Interaction, Internet of Things, Data Mining. Many of those projects has been deployed into production systems in John Deere, Pfizer, CitiBank and IBM internally. </p>

<p>Education Background</p>

<p>Utah State University, MS in Computer Science, 2004</p>

<p>Harbin Institute of Technology, Ph.D, 2024</p>

<p>Key Skills </p>

<p>Worked on PyTorch, TensorFlow, used multiple deep learning models to do training and inference on real world data. </p>

<p>Familiar with multiple Machine Learning algorithm, brought projects like Intelligent Customer Service, NLU into the production system. </p>

<p>Software Development, Data Mining, Experience with SOA, Cloud, API design and development. Familiar or have worked on programming languages including: Java, C#, Go, Python, JS.</p>

<p>Manage research and development teams on multiple projects. </p>

<p>Working Experiences</p>

<p>2018.04 - Current Lily Software Inc, Manager/Engineer, R&amp;D</p>

<p>Projects and Responsibilities: </p>

<p>Coordinate, directing multiple business divisions on joint efforts products research and development; Responsible for deliver research project including Natural Language Understanding in Movie and Television domain, Intelligence Customer Service. </p>

<p>Project: Intelligent Customer Service System</p>

<p>The customer service system has been applied in the client's internal EIP system. The system is mainly divided into three modules: intention recognition, standard problem matching, and similar problem matching. Find accurate answers through question matching.</p>

<p>Project: Construction of Knowledge Map based on Film and Television Domain</p>

<p>Collect data from different data sources into a central database through crawlers, followed by data cleansing, merge, establishing relationships, and feed them into a graph database. Make Q &amp; A based queries on knowledge map.</p>

<p>Project: Configurable Natural Language Training and Inference System</p>

<p>Establish a natural language training and reasoning system. The system includes model training network based on configurable system. The system can be extended to provide system support on rapid modeling.</p>

<p>Project: Speech Emotion Classification</p>

<p>Classify six different emotions using non-verbal vocal expressions, designed a two backbone models. The first is a dual-channel neural network model using CRNN and DNN. The second is xgboost. The combination of those two models processes the non-verbal vocal expression to get the classification results. </p>

<p>Project: Voice Wake-up and VoicePrint Recognition</p>

<p>A combination of voice wake-up and voice print. The system enable personalized voice wake-up. Followed by noise reduction and ASR. It is a web-based system. </p>

<p>2008.03 - 2018.03  IBM Research/Development Manager, Architect, Sr. Engineer</p>

<p>Projects and Responsibilities: </p>

<p>Project: Jonh Deere, Big Data, ERP System, 2010.07 - 2012.09</p>

<p>The project has two parts: building big data platform and upgrading existing legacy ERP system. As project Architect, I have worked with the team design and develop the data warehouse, data cubes, and data visualization portal. The project phase two is to upgrade Power Builder based ERP system to a .NET based platform. The architecture is API based solution with Security, Auditing, Fault-tolerance in focus.      </p>

<p>Project: IBM Intelligent Customer Service System, 2012.09 - 2014.03</p>

<p>The project was a joint effort of two teams based in USA and Canada. As the project architect and engineer for this project, I worked with the team designed and implemented the human to machine conversational system. The system divide knowledge into four different pillars: hardware, software, servers, and services. Each pillar is a pre-defined domain content. With each conversation with the human, the machine will get closer to the targeted knowledge. The system is implemented on RSA, Java, based on Ontology, MongoDB. It has been deployed on IBM internal product line. </p>

<p>Project: Pfizer, Big Data and System Integration, 2014.04 - 2016.04</p>

<p>Worked on products marketing system for pfizer as Solution Architect. The team is globally distributed in India, Europe, and China. While working with Pfizer executives in New York City, we built a content management system including SOLR, Lucene, with added Machine Learning Algorithms on targeted customers. The system back end connects to Pfizer's backbone SAP system.  </p>

<p>Project: CitiBank, Wealth Managment Platform, 2016.04 - 2018.03</p>

<p>The project has 4 teams in developing Wealth Management Platform for Citibank in New York. I coordinated business team and data provider to accomplish required tasks. The development team consisted of UI design team, back-end SOA team, and two front-end IoS Teams. Each team has 10 engineers. I guided the back-end SOA team in API design and development. Established Agile management for all teams. As the development team lead for this project, I have also focused security in design from start. The system went live successfully. It provides Citibank customers to do stock, option trade, bank wealth products purchases, and other bank defined wealth products.  </p>
